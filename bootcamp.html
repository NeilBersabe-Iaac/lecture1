    <h2>Bootcamp Introduction to Web Development Tools</h2>
    <h1>MACAD BIM and Smart Construction 2022</h1><br>
<br><hr><br>
<p>
    In this course you will learn about the basics of web development tools.
    
    First you will learn about a tool for version control called <em> Git</em>, which 
    can be extended to the web through a server for respositories called <a href="www.Github" target="_blank"> Github.</a>
    Along with it you will be introduce to the  glorified text editor  <strong> Visual Studio Code</strong> , which allows you write and debug code in the browser through
    a web server.
    
    </p><p>
    In the following sessions, you will learn the basics about the three main
    componentes for modern web development:
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>HTML</li> 
        <li>CSS</li> 
        <li>Javascript</li> 
    </ol>
<p>
    Finally (if we have enough time left), you will be introduced to Github Pages,
    a feature that will allow you to host your sites in the web through Github.
